Hello Play Testers!

This File is made to help you give me feedback on the game, here are just some things to consider to help me make
the game fun and intuitive!

Visuals : How does the game look?
    Is the loading screen Ugly? Any ideas on how to make it look better?

    Is the background to the Map and Shop Ugly?

    Is the Shop Ugly?

    Are the Information Boxes Ugly? Any Ideas on how they could look better?

    Is the Art for the Units/Map Ugly?

Intuitiveness : How easy is it to know whats going on?
    Is the Loading Screen easy to Navigate?

    Is the Game Info Screen (Top Right of Map) useful? What is it Missing?

    Is it clear which Units/Territories belong to who?

    When Purchasing a Unit, is the process intuitive? Does the Visual Process of buying the Unit make Sense?

    Does the Info Box (Under Shop) give Useful Info on the Territory/Unit? What could be more clear? Anything Missing?

    Does the Unit Info Box (Bottom Left of Map) give Useful Info? What could be more clear? Anything Missing?

    When representing territories, is it clear how many/how powerful the territory is? Do you think this is a
    useful and clear representation for the territory? What else do you think the player should see?

    When representing Seas/Coasts, is it clear how many/how powerful Units are? Same as with territories really...

    When representing Units with other Units Embarked onto them, is clear to the player? What could be done better?

    General Intuitiveness, when you play, what doesn't make sense?

Gameplay : What is Broken/Underpowered, as well as what is not working as it should? Gameplay Bugs.
    WARNING : Because this is a new game, please don't just decide something is Overpowered/Underpowered immediately!
    I would like to see a few game splayed and allow players to see what works as well as try different strategies
    before changing the game!

    Any Bugs? Is a Unit not working how it should?

    Does a Unit interact in an unintuitive way? Maybe a trade worked differently than how you expected or how
    you think it should. Let me know!

    Does something seem blatantly Over/Under powered? We want to make sure each Unit is healthy to the game.

NOTE : Visuals and Intuitiveness are by far the most important to notice here! Balancing the game usually requires
	changing one line of code!
